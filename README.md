#Project 9 - Responsive Web Application Dashboard
The goal of this project is to create a responsive dashboard using best practices and following industry standards. Its also wise to utilize 3rd party libraries and take advantage of all the cool features available on the web.

- I used a JavasScript library called charts.js, they helped me embed good looking charts on the website.
- time taken is about ~1 week due to me being stuck at certain parts like how to swap datasets around and trying to make the canvas more responsive. Also refining lots of small details
- Cross browser compatibility tested in Google Chrome, Firefox and IE Edge
- I used Sass in the beginning and then converted it to CSS at the end for this project, it certainly speeds up the process.
